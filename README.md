# Password_Protected_Files
I have made a basic server that allows you to upload files with password protection. 
It is made using Node,Express,Multer and Bcrypt. 
This project helped me learn Mongoose and basoc backend servers in great detail.  
###Some Special Features of My Website
1)You can add 2 files of the same name and it will not overwrite the second file over the first.  

2)Passwords are hashed to prevent leaking  

3)There can be a same password for 2 different files without any conflicts.
